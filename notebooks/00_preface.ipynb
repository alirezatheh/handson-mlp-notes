    "# Preface\n",
    "In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published a paper [“A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets”](https://homl.info/136) showing how to train a deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-of-the-art precision (>98%). They branded this technique “deep learning”. Despite the fact that Yann LeCun’s deep convolutional neural networks had worked well for image recognition since the 1990s, although they were not as general-purpose, training a deep neural net was widely considered impossible at the time, and most researchers had abandoned the idea in the late 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decade later, machine learning conquered many industries, from ranking web results to even driving cars. e.g. DeepMind’s AlphaFold solved a long-standing protein-folding problem that won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for founder and CEO Demis Hassabis and director John Jumper of in DeepMind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also Geoffrey Hinton was awarded the 2018 Turing Award (with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio) and the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics (with John Hopfield) for work on neural nets back in the 1980s."
